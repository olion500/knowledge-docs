# Automated Internal Knowledge Workflow System - Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for an automated internal knowledge workflow system. The system leverages GPT-4 and other tools (Slack, Notion, Confluence) to create summaries, context-aware Q&A, and micro knowledge bases from existing team communication. The initial focus is on core functionality – enabling users to 'ask' and receive accurate responses – with operational and administrative features to follow. A soft beta is planned for mid-July, with a full rollout targeted for the end of summer.

## Key Points

*   Automating internal knowledge workflows by processing existing communication from Slack, Notion, Confluence, and Google Drive.
*   GPT-4 is the core Large Language Model (LLM), with plans for embedding tuning and history-based fine-tuning.
*   The system aims to create summaries, context-aware Q&A, and micro knowledge bases.
*   The initial focus is on core functionality: enabling users to 'ask' and receive accurate responses.
*   Operational and administrative features will be implemented after the core functionality is stable.
*   A soft beta is planned for mid-July, with a full rollout by the end of summer.

## Decisions Made

*   **LLM Selection:** GPT-4 was selected as the core LLM for its capabilities.
*   **Technology Stack:** The following technologies were chosen:
    *   Backend: NestJS
    *   Frontend: Next.js & Tailwind
    *   Cloud Infrastructure: AWS (ECS, RDS, Redis)
    *   LLM Framework: LangChain
*   **Chunk Size:** The input chunk size will be limited to approximately 1.2K tokens to optimize performance and context window management.

## Action Items

*   [Assignee: U03TE1JCU5D] Review the Product Requirements Document (PRD) on Notion.
*   [Assignee: All Participants] Provide feedback on the system as it develops.
*   [Assignee: Development Team] Kick off the development sprint.

## Participants

*   U03TE1JCU5D

## Technical Details

*   **LLM:** GPT-4
*   **Backend Framework:** NestJS
*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with Tailwind CSS
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS (Elastic Container Service - ECS, Relational Database Service - RDS, Redis)
*   **LLM Framework:** LangChain
*   **Token Limit:** ~1.2K tokens per input chunk

## Context

This project aims to improve internal knowledge sharing and accessibility. The system will reduce the time spent searching for information and improve the accuracy of responses to common questions.  The PRD on Notion provides more detailed requirements and specifications.
